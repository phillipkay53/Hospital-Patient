# Hospital Patient Dashboard (Power BI)

## Objective
To design and develop a dynamic and interactive Hospital Patient Dashboard using Power BI that visualizes critical KPIs related to patient waitlist data, helping to understand hospital performance over time and make data-driven decisions.

## Data Source
The dataset for this project includes multiple CSV files containing waitlist data for both inpatient and outpatient services from 2018 to 2021, as well as a mapping of specialties.

## Process
1. **Data Extraction and Cleaning**: Extracted data from the provided CSV files and cleaned it using Power BIâ€™s data transformation tools.
2. **Data Aggregation and Analysis**: Calculated key metrics and KPIs to analyze hospital performance.
3. **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize trends in patient waitlists, specialty performance, and other critical metrics.

## Findings and Insights
- **Waitlist Trends**: Identified trends in patient waitlists over the years.
- **Specialty Performance**: Analyzed waitlist data across different specialties.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated key performance metrics to understand hospital efficiency.

## Recommendations
- **Resource Allocation**: Adjust resource allocation based on waitlist trends and specialty performance.
- **Process Improvements**: Implement process improvements to reduce wait times.
- **Targeted Strategies**: Develop targeted strategies to improve performance in specialties with longer wait times.
